Firstly i have created the EC2 instance which is running on the Nginx webservice.
I have connected using theEC2 instance connect and used these commands to install Nginx and start the service:
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1.12 -y
sudo service nginx start

After the Nginx service is started i checked if theindex.html directory is present using: 
find /usr/share/nginx/html

Then i have created a simple HTML file at /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html. The HTML code is as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Text Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my text page.</p>
</body>
</html>

Use this Public IP to check for the deployed web application: 13.50.245.32
